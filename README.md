# Flink - Bridging the Gender Gap in Tech

## Inspiration
**Flink** was founded out of a thought-provoking question: _What if women in technology had a dynamic platform where they could quickly connect, work together, and motivate one another to close the gender gap?_ Our quest to establish an environment where women and other underrepresented groups can prosper in the digital sector was spurred by this question.

## Learning Experience & Development
We discovered during **flink**'s development how critical it is to foster an inclusive and encouraging environment in the tech sector. We learned about the effectiveness of sponsorship, mentorship, and customized opportunities in enabling people to achieve professional success. Furthermore, we realized that diversity is a crucial component for encouraging creativity and bringing about constructive change in the digital industry, not merely a trendy term. Flink is a feature-rich web application designed to empower women and underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We developed a seamless user experience by utilizing **Docker** for containerization and **Spring Boot** for the **RESTful API**. For effective matchmaking and communication, we also used a database to store and manage user profiles and matches.

## Tools Used
* **Front-End (React Framework, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript)**
* **API (RESTful Web Service)**
